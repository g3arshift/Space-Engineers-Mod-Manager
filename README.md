# SEMM - Space Engineers Mod Manager
SEMM is designed to simplify the management of mods for Space Engineers. It supports importing and exporting modlists for easy sharing, makes it easy to reorganize load orders, and maintains its modlists independently from the saves so it is easy to apply a common modlist across multiple saves. Mods can be imported from Steam Workshop URL's or ID's, Steam Workshop Collections, Mod.io URL's or ID's, existing Space Engineers saves, or from a list of URL's in a file.

It can do this for either Space Engineers servers or clients, providing a far easier way to manage mods for complex builds or server setups. Currently, seven different themes are supported with three light and four dark.

Currently tested on Windows 10 and 11. It functions with Linux but there are minor UI bugs.
